This repository contains a basic data logger script for the  "Modules &amp; Jumper Wires" data logger described at

In general you only have to do four things to add a new sensor to your logger :

1) Download an #include the library that drives your sensor. This is usually provided by the sensor vendor (Adafruit, Sparkfun, etc) 
2) Connect your sensor as appropriate. The easiest ones to work with are often I2C sensors, which should be connected in parallel with the RTC module (which is also an I2C device)
3) Add commands to take a reading from that sensor and put it into a variable at the beginning of the main loop. This is usually means adding:   YourSensorReadingVariable=readsensor();   functions provided by the library
4) In the middle of the code where the data is concatenated into the dataString add:

dataString += ", "; //comma separates new data from that already in the string
dataString = dataString + String(YourSensorReadingVariable);

You will find an introduction to the different types of sensors that you can use with the UNO logger at:

Just make sure that the sensor you want to use can handle the UNO's 5V rail.
